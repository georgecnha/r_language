# Character strings are entered using either matching double (") 
# or single (â€™) quotes, but are printed using double quotes 
# (or sometimes without quotes). They use C-style escape sequences,
# using \ as the escape character, so \ is entered and printed as \\, 
# and inside double quotes " is entered as \". 
# Other useful escape sequences are \n, newline, \t, tab and \b, 
# backspace - see ?Quotes for a full list.
